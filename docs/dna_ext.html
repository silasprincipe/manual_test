          <p class="form-box-title">You have DNA derived data</p>
          <p>This genetic data may come from a sampling event, an individual organism, may be linked to physical material (or not), or may result from DNA detection methods e.g., metabarcoding or qPCR. Thus genetic data may reflect a single organism, or may include information from bulk samples with many individuals. Still, DNA-derived occurrence data of species should be documented as standardized and as reproducible as possible.</p>
